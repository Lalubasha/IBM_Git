## Introduction

Version control is crucial for efficient software development. This repository aims to guide you through essential Git commands, GitHub collaboration, forking projects, hosting static websites, and managing changes confidently.

## Git Commands

Here are fundamental Git commands for version control:

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone [repository_url]`: Clone a remote repository to your local machine.
- `git add [file_name]`: Stage changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Commit staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
- `git push`: Push your local commits to a remote repository.
- `git branch`: List existing branches.
- `git checkout [branch_name]`: Switch to a different branch.
- `git merge [branch_name]`: Merge changes from one branch into another.

## GitHub Basics

GitHub is a platform for hosting projects and collaborating:

- Create and manage repositories.
- Collaborate using pull requests.
- Track issues and manage project progress.
- Utilize GitHub Pages to host static websites.

Explore [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) for comprehensive information.

## Forking Repositories

Forking allows you to make a personal copy of a repository:

1. Click "Fork" on the repository you want to fork.
2. Clone your forked repository locally.
3. Make changes, commit, and push.
4. Create a pull request to suggest changes to the original repository.

## Hosting

GitHub Pages provides free hosting for static websites:

1. Create a `gh-pages` branch or use the `docs` folder in your main branch.
2. Customize your site content (HTML, CSS, etc.).
3. Access your site at `https://username.github.io/repository`.

## Undoing Changes

Mistakes happen! Git offers ways to undo changes:

- `git reset`: Unstage changes.
- `git checkout -- [file_name]`: Discard changes in a file.
- `git revert [commit]`: Create a new commit that undoes a previous commit.
